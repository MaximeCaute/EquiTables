    Input:
        - data_to_match: pandas DataFrame.
            The part of data that should be matched.
        - data_to_differentiate: pandas DataFrame.

    Parameters:
        - groups_size: int. The sizes of the group to create.
            Defaults to groups of size 2 (TO BE CHANGED)
    Outputs:
