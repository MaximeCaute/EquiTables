"To demonstrate the capabilities of our Match program,
we selected a published study in which a complicated
matching solution was needed, which had already been
solved by hand. The study chosen was "Effects of Word
Length and Frequency on the Human Event-Related Potential" 
by Hauk and Pulvermuller (2004). They performed
a lexical decision experiment to investigate the influence of word
length and frequency of occurrence on the visually evoked
event-related potential to written words. Their word stim-
uli were grouped into six conditions, in a 2 3 3 factorial
design with length (short vs. long words) and frequency
(low-, medium-, and high-frequency words) as indepen-
dent variables. Words were matched for length in the three
frequency conditions, and for both word form and lemma
frequency in the two length conditions. "
